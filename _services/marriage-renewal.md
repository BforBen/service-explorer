These ceremonies give married couples the opportunities to renew their marriage vows and to celebrate their married years together. Every ceremony will be unique and special people in the couples lives can be invited to take part in the ceremony. Ceremonies are secular and do not contain religious references. They are not restricted to the couples area of residence. The ceremony has no legal status and the couples marriage certificate must be shown before a ceremony can be booked.
