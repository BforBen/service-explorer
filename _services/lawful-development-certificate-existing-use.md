A Certificates of Lawful Use or Development for existing use (CLEUD) can be issued to establish that an existing use of land, or some operational development, or some activity in breach of a planning condition, is lawful. An application for a CLEUD may be made in response to planning enforcement action or to confirm that the property cannot be subject to enforcement action in the future.
