The design and construction of buildings is controlled by ensuring Building Warrant applications comply with Building Regulations for most classes and types of building, whether public or private and includes houses, shops, leisure facilities, factories, warehouses etc. A Building Warrant application is required for the erection, change of use, alteration or extension of a building and is also necessary for the demolition of a property. It is valid for three years and construction work cannot begin before the Building Warrant has been approved.  A statutory register of all building warrants must be maintained.
