Court housing advice and reprementation schemes aim to provide free, independent and confidential advice and representation to homeowners and tenants attending hearings in possession proceedings brought on grounds of arrears, who either have not previously obtained advice and/or are without legal reprementation. 
In Scotland, the Shelter and Law Centre aims to provide free advice and support.
