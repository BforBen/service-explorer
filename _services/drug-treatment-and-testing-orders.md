Free-standing order which can run in parallel with a Probation Order.  The order is supervised by an officer of the local authority whose role is to maintain overall control of the order, keeping abreast of the treatment side to report on progress to the court and ensure that work is being done to tackle other issues related to the subject's offending.  The drug court team is an interdisciplinary team  which has criminal justice social workers, addiction workers and medical staff working closely together.  This enables an intensive assessment and supervision service to be provided which research has shown is effective in reducing drug dependency and related offending behaviour.
