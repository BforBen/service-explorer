Provision of a facility whereby people who cannot attend the polling station (usually for reasons of ill-health or employment) on an election day can nominate another person who will vote on their behalf.  The proxy must be eligible to vote in the election themself in order to act on behalf of another person. In Scotland, the council provides forms to register to vote by proxy.
