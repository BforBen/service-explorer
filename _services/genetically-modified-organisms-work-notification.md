  Added in version 4.00.

Anyone intending to work with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in contained use facilities must notify the appropriate authority before work begins and a fee must be paid.  Consent is required before higher risk work can begin.  The information submitted as part of the notification is subject to inclusion on a public register, unless the information is in a category that qualifies for confidentiality.
