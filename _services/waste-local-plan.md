A Waste Local Plan is a statutory plan that addresses the land-use aspects of waste management. It deals with all waste managed in the area including that generated by businesses and the construction industry in addition to that produced by households. 
In Scotland National Policy Planning Guideline 10 (NPPG 10) establishes that the land use implications of waste management will be addressed by an area's local plan(s) and that policy will incorporate the objectives of the National and Area Waste Strategy.
