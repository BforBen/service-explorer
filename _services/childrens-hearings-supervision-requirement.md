If a Children's Hearing thinks compulsory measures of supervision are appropriate it will impose a supervision requirement, which may be renewed annually until the child becomes 18. The hearing has a wide scope to insert any condition in a Supervision Requirement, and the local authority is responsible for ensuring that it is implemented. In most cases the child will continue to live at home but will be under the supervision of a social worker. In some cases the hearing will decide that the child should live away from his home with relatives or foster parents, or in one of several establishments managed by local authority or voluntary organisations, such as children's homes, residential schools or secure accommodation. A hearing does not have power to fine the child or young person or his parents. All decisions made by hearings are legally binding on that child or young person.
