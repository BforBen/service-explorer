The local authority provides support and assistance to residents who are victims of a crime such as homophobic crime, racist crime, or general crime committed in their home or whilst in the vicinity of their home. If the resident is a council tenant and the council are unable to resolve the problem they may offer the tenant the chance of being re-housed in a different area.
