The Children's Panel makes vital decisions about vulnerable children in need of care or who have offended, at a Children's Hearing.
Each hearing is a lay tribunal involving three members of the panel and must consist of at least one man and one woman. It should also where possible reflect a mix of ages and experience.
The hearing is usually held in a relatively informal setting and is chaired by one of the panel members.
The local authority provides information about how to become a children's panel member. 
In Scotland the children's hearings system relies on the involvement of around 2,500 volunteers who give their time and commitment to training and serving as children's panel members.
