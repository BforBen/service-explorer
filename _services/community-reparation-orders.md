CROs are a low tariff order and will be confined to summary cases - i.e. crimes of a less serious nature that are heard without a jury in the district and sheriff courts. They focus specifically on making reparation for anti-social behaviour by providing 10 to 100 hours of unpaid work. CROs will expand the existing range of community disposals. Existing disposals with a restorative element are either high tariff, for example community service orders, or designed to deal with a specific group, such as supervised attendance orders for fine defaulters
