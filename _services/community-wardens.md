Wardens deal with a range of quality of life issues, such as keeping neighbourhoods clean, removing graffiti and reporting any issues to the relevant organisations and authorities. The Wardens work with the Police and other agencies to help reduce crime, the fear of crime and all types of antisocial behaviour.
