The criminal justice social work department provide assistance in finding suitable accommodation. The court needs to maintain contact with an accused person during the process of their case. As such, where a person lives has a significant effect on the bail decision. Bail accommodation aims to decrease unnecessary custodial remands by assisting those who are either homeless or who are otherwise unable to offer an acceptable address. Courts can attach a condition of residence to a bail order.
