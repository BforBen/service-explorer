The Animal welfare sections responds to both reports from the public, and undertakes proactive patrols. The aims of the service are to reduce the risk to human health from domesticated animals and/or the premises where they are kept, to prevent nuisance from pet animals or from the keeping or boarding of pet animals and to reduce the risk to animal health arising from commercial keeping of pet or similar non-livestock animals.
