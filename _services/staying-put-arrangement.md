When a fostered child reaches the age of 18 he/she can no longer be considered a 'child in care'.  However, if he/she and their foster carer want to continue living together then the placement can become a 'Staying Put' arrangement. A child can start making plans towards this around their 16th birthday if he/she and the foster carer think this might be the best plan for him/her on becoming 18 years old.
