Respite care is a form of short-term substitute care provided by someone other than the parents or usual carers for a child. Respite care is a key support to families and is organised to suit the needs of the particular child and family. It can take place in a hospital, residential setting or in the child's own home.It gives parents free time to give them a rest, to spend time with their other children or in an emergency.
