School governors are typically volunteers from the school's community. They must be aged 18 or over at the date of their election or appointment. They have three key roles of setting strategic direction, ensuring accountability and monitoring and evaluating school performance. 
In Scotland, parent councils replaced school boards. They help decide the direction, focus and ethos of schools, and represent and communicate with parents. Each school can write its own constitution for its parent council.
