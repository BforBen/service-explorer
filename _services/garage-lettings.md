Garages may be available for rent to council tenants, leaseholders and private tenants and a waiting list is usually maintained for these. The authority will process applications and issue rental agreements which usually include restrictions on the use of the garage.  The Council is generally responsible for making structural repairs to its property, which includes garage blocks. Where the damage has been caused by the leaseholder they may be asked to pay for the repairs.
