The Care and Repair project is for elderly or disabled owner/occupiers or private sector tenants who require repairs or improvements to their home. The service excludes decoration, gardening, fencing, slabbing etc.  Clients are required to pay the cost of the materials only. A hardship fund will operate to pay for materials in limited cases. If you are unsure whether the small repairs service can assist, please telephone for advice.
