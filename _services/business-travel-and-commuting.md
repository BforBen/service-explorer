The purpose of a business transport plan is to promote alternative methods of transport (e.g. bicycles, public transport, car pools ..) for home-to-work commuting  or the personnel of  the town itself as well as for the staff of companies/establishments. This is possible by giving information and pointing out the alternative methods of transport for the home-work commute and by stimulating alternative methods of transport in home to work commuting.
