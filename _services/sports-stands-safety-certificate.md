A safety certificate is required in respect of the use, at a sports ground, which is not a designated sports ground, (i.e. stadiums with a capacity of more than 10,000, or in the case of a Premier or Football League ground, more than 5,000), of each stand which provides covered accommodation for 500 or more spectators to view activities at the ground. Such a stand is referred to as a 'regulated stand'.
