Food legislation places an obligation on food business operators to ensure that all their activities are carried out in a hygienic way and makes it an offence to supply food which is unsafe or harmful to human health. 
In the UK local authorities are responsible for ensuring that businesses comply with these requirements. Environmental health teams deal with hygiene except at primary production (farms), where trading standards and other bodies have responsibility.
