The aim of countryside education is to foster an understanding of the ways in which living things, both plant and animal work together to shape the environment we live in.  To achieve this  outdoor classroom sessions in and around our visitor centres, in your local countryside, or in schools may be provided.   Educational packs containing useful projects and worksheets may be provided.
