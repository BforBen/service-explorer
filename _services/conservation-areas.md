Councils have the power to designate as Conservation Areas, areas of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance. It is the responsibility of the council to ensure that any new development should be sympathetic to the special architectural and aesthetic qualities of the area, particularly in terms of scale, design, materials and space between buildings.  Councils have a statutory obligation to compile a list containing particulars of any area which has been designated as a conservation area which is available for public inspection.
