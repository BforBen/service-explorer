Local authorities control demolition in the interests of safety and to ensure that any disturbance and/or inconvenience to the public and occupiers/owners of adjacent properties is kept to a minimum.  Anyone wishing to demolish a building or part of a building,is required to notify the local authority which will then normally issue a demolition notice specifying steps to be taken during the demolition works to ensure public safety.
