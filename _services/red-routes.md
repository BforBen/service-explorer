On certain main roads in yellow lines indicating a parking ban have been replaced by red lines (or alternative markings such as greenways etc.). Unlike yellow lines, alternative markings prohibit all stopping, parking and loading.  Red routes are designed to ensure the free flow of traffic and that bus routes are kept clear at all times.
