All public bodies have a duty to ensure that their use of resources is economic, efficient and effective. A value for money review typically takes account of the mix of quality, cost, resource usage, fitness for purpose, timeliness, convenience plus a measure of the cost of goods and services to judge whether or not, together, they constitute good value.  A report on any review or key points from a review are published for information.
