The Council should have a continuing programme of schemes to improve the safety and operation of the highway network. Many of these schemes originate from requests made by the public.  As well as concerns about the safety of individual road junctions, there are requests for pedestrian crossing facilities, speed restraint measures (such as road humps), and minor issues such as new warning signs.
