If a death occurs abroad, the death should be registered according to the local regulations of that country. 
To bring a body back to England or Wales either the Death Certificate or an authorisation for the removal of the body from the country of death is needed. The registrar in the district in which the funeral is to take place has to issue a 'Certificate of No Liability to Register'. 
You can bring a body back to Scotland once you have got the death certificate and an authorisation for the removal of the body from the country of death from the appropriate authorities. To bring the body into Scotland you will need either an autmenticated translation of a foreign death certificate or a death certificate issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, depending on the place of death.
