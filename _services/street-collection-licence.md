"Permission must be granted by the local authority before a street collection can take place. Application should be made to the local authority with sufficient notice prior to the date on which the collection is due to take place. This requirement applies to all organisations that collect from a street or a public highway. 
In Scotland permission must be granted by the local authority for Public Charitable Collections."@en
