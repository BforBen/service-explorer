"Any person who intends to carry out work in the capacity of a door supervisor (bouncer), in premises licensed for public entertainment, must first obtain registration with the local authority. Applications are usually subject to a satisfactory police check. 
In Scotland in some local authority areas it is mandatory to have a licence to work as a door supervisor. However, there is currently no national requirement and the private security industry in Scotland is not yet regulated."@en
