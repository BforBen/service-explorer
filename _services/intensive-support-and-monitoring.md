A range of powers designed to deal specifically with those young people involved in nuisance behaviour for whom existing measures have proved ineffective. One of the provides childrens hearings with the power to impose conditions restricting the movement of a young person, where that young person meets the criteria for secure accommodation. Remote monitoring conditions will be applied where the hearings believe it will help stop persistent offending, or if the welfare needs of the child could be addressed through a tag. This condition can help to restrict young people to, or away from, certain locations at particular times. Where it is agreed that a tag is the best course of action an intensive community based service covering all of the young persons needs will be put in place to support these arrangements, creating an intensive Support and Monitoring Service (ISMS).
