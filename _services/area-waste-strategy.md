The Aim of an Area Waste Plan (AWP) is to contribute to the sustainable development of the area by developing waste management systems that will control waste generation, reduce its environmental impact, improve resource efficiency, stimulate investment and maximise the economic opportunities arising from waste. The AWP covers all types of waste (household, commercial, industrial) but initially focuses on municipal waste (MW).
