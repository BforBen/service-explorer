  Added scope notes in version 3.11.

---

An asylum seeker who has exhausted all legal procedures but has not left the country, can notify the municipal authority of change of address. However, the new address cannot be used on any document and no certificates can be provided.  The notification is of value because the person concerned does not disappear completely illegally and remains accountable before the authorities.
