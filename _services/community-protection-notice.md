A Community Protection Notice can be issued to stop a business, organisation or person over the age of 16 committing anti-social behaviour which spoils the community's quality of life. It can be used to deal with particular on-going problems or nuisances which negatively impact on or affect the community, by targeting those responsible. It can cover a wide range of anti-social behaviours and can be used against a wide range of perpetrators.
