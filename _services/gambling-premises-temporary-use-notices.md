Temporary use notices (TUN) allow the use of premises for gambling where there is no premises licence but where a gambling operator wishes to use the premises temporarily for providing facilities for gambling.  A temporary use notice must be lodged with the licensing authority not less than 3 months and 1 day before the day on which the gambling event will begin.
