Any waste generated by a commercial organisation is the responsibility of the organisation to dispose of correctly. Advice on how to dispose of waste may be given by the council (including details of local organisations who offer waste collection services). The council may also provide a service which can arrange for special collections of large amounts of waste, bulky materials or confidential waste from commercial premises for a fee.
