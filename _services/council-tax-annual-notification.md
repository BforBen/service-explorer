Council tax is payable on domestic dwellings and is charged by the local authority to pay for the services it provides.  The council tax rates should be published each year together with information on how rates are assessed, eligibility, how to pay etc.  The council should also provide information on how to appeal if you think your council tax bill is incorrect.
