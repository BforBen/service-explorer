Local authority run housing is expected to be of a suitable standard as defined by national legislation.
In England the Government requires all local housing authorities to achieve a new 'decent homes' standard by 2010 and to consult with tenants, leaseholders and other stakeholders about how best to achieve this and other wishes for service improvements. 
In Scotland local authorities and registered social landlords are expected to ensure that their stock meets the Scottish Housing Quality Standards by 2015 as set by the Scottish Executive and Communities Scotland.
