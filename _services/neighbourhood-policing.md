Neighbourhood Policing teams work within their communities to understand local priorities - whether that's tackling anti-social behaviour, dealing with problems caused by drug use, or stopping alcohol-related crime. Every community throughout England and Wales now has a dedicated Neighbourhood Policing team in place to solve local problems. The teams provide a visible and contactable presence in the community and work hard to keep neighbourhoods safe.
