"A licence is required for placing building materials on any part of a highway. Licences are only issued in exceptional circumstances for any duration up to a month. The applicant can extend this before the granted licence expires. 
In Scotland if you propose to occupy or open part of a road (i.e.. carriageway, footway, footpath or cycle path etc), there is a requirement to obtain permission from the local Roads Authority. This is done by applying for the relevant permit."@en
