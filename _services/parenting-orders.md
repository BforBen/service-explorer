A court may make an order on a parent or guardian of a juvenile (10 to 16 years old) who is convicted of an offence , a child of 10 and over made the subject of an anti-social behaviour order or a sex offender order, and a child under 10 made subject to a child safety order. Parenting Orders are not about punishing parents but about getting parents to change their behaviour in respect of their child, and to take responsibility. Before a Parenting Order can be made, parents must have refused to engage voluntarily with support made available to help them improve their parenting.
