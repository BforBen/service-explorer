A rail card (or other travel concession) is available to local citizens if they are aged 60 and over, they are physically disabled or they have a learning difficulty.  Eligibility for a rail card or a combined travel concession card will need to be assessed.  Depending on the degree of need the rail card may offer either free travel or travel at a reduced rate.
