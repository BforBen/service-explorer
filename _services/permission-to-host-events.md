All events and activities held on publicly owned land require permission to be obtained in advance. This applies to events of all sizes, from small community initiatives and promotion days to large scale productions that attract thousands of spectators. Organisers will usually be required to submit an application and may be asked to provide insurance details, necessary permits/licences/certificates and health and safety information. Whilst permission is not needed for events which are to be held on private land it is recommended that the authorities are advised so that they can ensure adequate health and safety arrangements are in place.
