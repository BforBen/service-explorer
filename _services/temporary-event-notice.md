"An event organiser who wishes to provide alcohol or certain types of entertainment must issue a Temporary Event Notice. The notice is issued to the local licensing authority (usually the borough, district or unitary council) and the police, either of whom can object to the Notice.
In Scotland, a temporary licence can only be applied for by a voluntary organisation and must be for an event for their benefit."@en
