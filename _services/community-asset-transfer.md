The transfer of land or buildings from the council's freehold ownership into the stewardship and/or ownership of third sector organisations.  Local people are often best placed to manage community facilities in their area. They already make extensive use of these assets and their local knowledge and hands-on management often results in lower overheads and better value-for-money.  Organisations are able to apply for a community asset transfer of facilities where they can put a business case and show the community benefit for doing so.
