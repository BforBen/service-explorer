The schools forum is made up of representatives from schools and academies in the local area. There is also some representation from non-school organisations, such as nursery and 16-19 education providers.  The forum acts as a consultative body on issues such as changes to the local funding formula, arrangements for children with special educational needs, in pupil referral units and in early years provision.  On other issues such as how much funding may be retained by the local authority within the dedicated schools grant (eg for providing an admissions service or providing additional funding for growing schools), proposed  carry forward of deficits etc. the schools forum acts as a decision making body.
