"A late night refreshment house Licence is required when a building (that does not have a justices licence in force) is kept open for public refreshment between 10 o'clock at night and 5 o'clock the following morning. Applications may be considered jointly by the local authority, police and fire authorities. 
In Scotland anyone operating a cafe, restaurant, take-away or fast food premises late at night has to apply for a late hours catering licence from the council. A late hours catering licence is required where premises are to be used between the hours of 11 p.m. and 5.00 a.m. for the sale of meals or refreshments to the public. This can be to eat or drink on or off the premises."@en
