A supervision order is a non custodial, or community sentence that is imposed on a young person (aged 11 – 17), either at a youth court or a crown court. The order requires the young person to be supervised by a member of the youth offending team (called the ‘supervising officer’). The order can be made for up to three years and is organised by the supervising officer, according to standards required by the Home Office.  The purpose of a supervision order is to help a young person do what is necessary to stop offending, and protect the public from harm.
