In areas where excessive speed is considered a risk to public safety the local authority may construct 'speed humps' for the purpose of reducing traffic speeds.  Speed humps are typically constructed in residential roads and in areas where there may be a large amount of pedestrian traffic (such as near school entrances). The local authority makes provision for speed road humps to reduce speeds and improve safety of residential roads.
