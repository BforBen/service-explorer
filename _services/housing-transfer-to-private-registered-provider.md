Housing transfer is the voluntary transfer of ownership of all or some of a local authority's tenanted and leasehold homes to a private registered provider in return for a payment for the value of that stock.  Authorities are encouraged to transfer where this represents good value for money and where it will lever in additional private investment that delivers growth through more affordable housing, local economic activity and providing a robust, long-term future for estates and neighbourhoods, including by compliance with the Decent Homes Standard.
