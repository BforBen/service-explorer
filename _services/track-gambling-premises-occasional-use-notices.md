Occasional use notices can be used to permit the use of tracks (as defined by theÂ Gambling Act 2005), to be used as premises for gambling, where there is no premises licence, but where a gambling operator wishes to use the premises temporarily for providing facilities for gambling.  The same premises can not provide facilities for gambling on more than 8 days in a calendar year.  Notice must be provided by a person who is responsible for the administration of events on the track or by an occupier of the track and must only be served on the Licensing Authority.
