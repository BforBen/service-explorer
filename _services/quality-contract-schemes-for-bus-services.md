Quality contract schemes are agreements between the council and local bus operators to improve the quality of services and facilities within the scheme area.  They may be between one council and a bus company or more than one of either.  Typically the council will undertake to provide bus priority measures, new bus stops and/or real time information systems.  In return bus operators provide new vehicles with improved levels of accessibility and environmental performance and/or enhanced driver training. They may also provide an enhanced level of service.
