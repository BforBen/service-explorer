The fundamental purpose of the Scientific Service is to protect the public from unfair or unsafe trade practices and to promote good health and clean environment for the benefit of local citizens and businesses.  The Service provides a scientific advisory and analytical service, of a quality acceptable to UK Government and the EC.  The service operates in four key areas - food standards, consumer safety, environmental protection and health and safety at work.
