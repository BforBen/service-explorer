The local authority, which controls the installation of any new or replacement domestic oil storage tank, will require a Building Notice to show that the work complies with current Building Regulations (unless the work is already covered under a full Building Regulations approval). Alternatively, the work can be done by a ‘competent person’. This is someone who can self-certify their own installation work.
