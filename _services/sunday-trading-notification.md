"Restrictions may exist on shop opening times on Sundays. Shops which wish to open are required to notify the local authority of their Sunday opening hours.
In th UK retrictions are confined to large shops (defined as those having an internal sales area of over 280m2). These shops must be registered with the council for trading on a Sunday, and specify the six hours of trading on a Sunday which must be between the hours of 10.00 to 18.00. Smaller shops may trade freely on a Sunday."@en
