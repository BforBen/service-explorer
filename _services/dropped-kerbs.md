The council may construct vehicle crossovers at the request of residents. Provision of crossovers may also include access protection markings which are white 'H' shaped lines painted on a road, in front of accesses to highlight dropped kerbs to other road users. There may be a charge payable for this service and in some locations, such as on major highways, planning permission may be required.
