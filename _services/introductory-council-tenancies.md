A new tenancy in local authority property does not generally become securefor a defined period after it starts. If at any time before the end of this period the tenant misbehaves the local authority can initiate proceedings to evict the tenant. 
In Scotland a Scottish short secure tenancy is a short term or probationary tenancy agreement which can be given to tenants by a council, housing association or housing co-op. SSSTs are offered: for lets for a trial period, after which your tenancy may be upgraded to a Scottish secure tenancy, or for temporary lets.
