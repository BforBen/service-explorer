Private tenants who think they are paying too much rent can get the councils rent services to inspect the property and set a fair rent appropriate to the property. Inspections are also carried out into homes in multiple occupation to look for disrepair, inadequate facilities, means of escape, dangerous or defective lifts, general mismanagement and overcrowding.
