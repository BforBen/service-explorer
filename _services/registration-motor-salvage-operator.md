Any person who carries on a business that involves the recovery of salvageable parts from motor vehicles and the subsequent sale or disposal for scrap of the remainder of the vehicle, or the purchase of 'written off' vehicles for repair or resale, or other related activities needs to register with their local authority. 
In Scotland the Road Safety Bill currently being considered by the Scottish Parliament may legislate in this area.
