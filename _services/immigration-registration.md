Sometimes there is discussion about whether foreigners must submit certificates when they register. The national register department is of the opinion that this is indispensable for registering all the details in the dossier. They base their case for this on the general instructions for keeping the population registers. Although it suffices for a first registration that a foreigner presents his passport, containing a visa, where necessary, it is indispensable for registering the details in the national register that the certificates are submitted which are necessary to be able to carry out this registration. In practice, it can involve a birth certificate, marriage certificate and/or divorce certificate, death certificate, declaration of adoption, etc.  A passport does ascertain the identity of a person, but does not give any conclusive information about origin or civil status.  When the certificates are issued all the legal details of the person in question are recorded in the document. They are thus indispensable in order to complete the dossier.
