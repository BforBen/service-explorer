Highways must be kept clear of obstructions for safety reasons. The local authority has the power to serve notice on a person who commits an offence of wilful obstruction on the highway. In certain circumstances the courts allow the highway authority to remove obstructions and recover reasonable costs incurred in doing so from the offender.
