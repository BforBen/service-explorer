Public weighbridges are available for use by businesses or the general public for the weighing of vehicles and objects where determination of a specific weight/load is important, including ensuring that vehicles are not overloaded.  Public weighbridges may be provided by the council or they may provide information on privately operated weighbridges in the area.
