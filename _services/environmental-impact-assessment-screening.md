Any proposed development over 0.5 hectares and/or which may have significant impact on the local environment may require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to be carried out as part of the planning application process.  The planning authority may provide advice regarding the need for an EIA and work with the applicant to scope the topics and detail to be covered in the environmental statement which needs to accompany the planning application.
