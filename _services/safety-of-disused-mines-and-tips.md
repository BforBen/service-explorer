The local authority are responsible for ensuring that there is no danger to the public caused by disused mines, quarries or tips in their area.  The authority can require the owners to carry out remedial work where such a site is potentially unsafe or may carry out the remedial work and reclaim expenses where the owner fails to act on notice to do so.
