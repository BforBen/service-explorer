Local authorities may declare the whole or part of the district of the authority to be a Smoke Control Area. It is an offence to emit smoke from a chimney of a building, (commercial or residential), from a furnace or from any fixed boiler if located in a designated smoke control area. It is also an offence to acquire an 'unauthorised fuel' for use within a Smoke Control Area unless it is used in an 'exempt' appliance ('exempted' from the controls which generally apply in the smoke control area).
