The Children Act 2004 requires each local authority to establish a Local Safeguarding Children Board. The board  is a partnership between all agencies, organisations and services  in an area with responsibility for safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children.  Typically this includes childrenâ€™s social care, police, education, early years and Sure Start, health services, youth offending teams and probation services.
