Education Development Plans (EDPs) are documents in which an education authority, in consultation with schools and other stakeholders, sets out costed plans for school improvement and raising pupils standards.
In England EDPs are a statutory requirement of all education authorities.
In Scotland legislation integrates school development plans into the new School Improvement Framework. The education authorities have a role in ensuring that a development plan and a summary are prepared for each school. After consultation, the date set for these plans is by June each year. There are also now specific criteria outlined for these plans.
