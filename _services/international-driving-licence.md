An International Driving Permit (IDP) is valid for 12 months from the date of issue.  Recognised internationally, an IDP normally allows the holder to drive a private motor vehicle when accompanied by a valid national driving licence.  Most countries require a 1949 Convention IDP but for certain countries, a 1926 Convention IDP is necessary.
