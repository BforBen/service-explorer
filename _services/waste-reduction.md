Waste reduction is a priority in most administrative areas and there are usually government backed initiatives to achieve waste reduction and recycling targets.
In the UK nappy waste prevention is prioritised in the government's Waste Implementation Programme (WIP), May 2003. The real nappy campaign and home composting have been chosen to lead the government's waste reduction strategy.
