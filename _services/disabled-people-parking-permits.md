Blue parking badges allow cars carrying people who are registered blind or people who have severe walking difficulties to be parked near shops, stations and other facilities.  Blue Badges can only be issued to people who meet the eligibility criteria, not to relatives or carers. They can be used in any car the badge holder is driving or is a passenger in.
