A casual vacancy may occur where a councillor resigns or dies or where he/she has failed to comply with regulations.  The council is required to post notice of the casual vacancy and to hold a by-election unless the vacancy occurs within six months of the end of the term of office.  Parish councils can co-opt a replacement councillor.
