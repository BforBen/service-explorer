Registration of a still-birth.
Every still-birth in England or Wales must be registered in the district in which it takes place, normally within 42 days. This normally takes place at the Register Office (although the still-birth may be registered in the hospital in which it took place). Following registration a certificate will be issued. 
A still birth may be registered in any Registration Office in Scotland provided the baby was born in Scotland. Still births occurring in Scotland must be registered within 21 days.
