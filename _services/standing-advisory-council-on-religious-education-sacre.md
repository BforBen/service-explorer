Every local authority with responsibility for education must establish a SACRE which advises the LA on matters relating to religious education, in accordance with its agreed syllabus, and on collective worship in community schools.  A SACRE is made up of representatives from the council, local religious groups and teachersâ€™ organisations and is mandated by law.
