The YOF money, which comes from the Government, is for young people, aged 13-19 (or up to aged 25 where the young people have special needs), to spend on activities and projects that improve things to do, places to go or develop confidence, skills and knowledge.  Generally applications for funding will go to a panel of young people from the local area, supported by Youth Services and other services, who are interested in encouraging everyone in their community to have a say.
