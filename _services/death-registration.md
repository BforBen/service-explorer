Registration of a death.
In England and Wales a death should be registered in the district in which it takes place within five days of the date of death. Upon receipt of all required information pertaining to the deceased person a death certificate is issued by the registrar. 
In Scotland any death which occurs must be registered within 8 days by the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages. A death may be registered in any Registration Office in Scotland provided the death was in Scotland.
