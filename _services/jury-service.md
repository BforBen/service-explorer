Jury service is something that some people may be asked to do in their lifetime. Being on a jury is a 'civic duty' and helps decide the outcome of criminal (and civil) trials in a court.  Jurors are typically chosen from the electoral register provided they fulfill any additional conditions imposed to determine eligibility such as age, length of residence, mental health etc.
