A council must make sure there is sufficient childcare provision in the local area to enable parents to work, or undertake education and training leading to work. To ensure there is sufficient childcare an assessment of supply and demand for childcare services within a local authority area is carried out at regular intervals, consulting with parents and childcare providers as appropriate.
