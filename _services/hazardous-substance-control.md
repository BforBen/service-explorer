Legislation may exist to control exposure to all substances hazardous to health arising from work activities. The local authority usually has responsibility for ensuring that these regulations are adhered to by catering establishments, offices and shops. 
In the UK the health and safety Executive (HSE) is generally responsible for manufacturing premises.
