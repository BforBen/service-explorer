The Youth Rehabilitation Order (YRO) is a generic community sentence for young offenders and combines a number of sentences into one generic sentence. It will be the standard community sentence used for the majority of children and young people who offend. It will simplify sentencing for young people, while improving the flexibility of interventions.
