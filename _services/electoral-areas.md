Electoral boundaries for a council area are decided by the Boundary Commission in consultation with the council and local residents.  The number of councillors representing each ward or area is decided as part of this process.  The council may request a review of current boundaries by the Boundary Commission at any time.  The council publish information regarding the current boundaries and any proposed changes.
