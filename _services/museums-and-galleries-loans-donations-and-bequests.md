Items exhibited in local museums and galleries may be provided by private individuals either on loan (usually for the duration of an exhibition), as a donation or as a bequest upon the death of the owner.  The local authority makes arrangements to receive the items, ensure their safety while on display and (where on loan) their return to the owner.
