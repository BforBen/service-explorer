Her Majesty's Lord-Lieutenants are the representatives of the Crown for each county in the United Kingdom.  Lord-Lieutenants are responsible for the organisation of all official Royal visits to their county.  Lord-Lieutenants also carry out other duties in their county, such as the presentation of decorations (where the recipient is unable to attend an Investiture), The Queen's Awards for Export and Technology, and Queen's Scout and Queen's Guide Awards.
