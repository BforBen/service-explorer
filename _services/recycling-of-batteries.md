Batteries are classified as hazardous waste because of the toxins that they contain, and therefore need to be disposed of differently from ordinary waste.  The council may provide a battery recycling facility at a local recycling centre or collect batteries as part of the kerbside recycling service.  The council may also provide information about other locations in the area where batteries can be recycled.
