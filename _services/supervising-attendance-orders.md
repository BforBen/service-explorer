A supervised attendance order is in effect a fine on time, which offenders require to use for constructive activity. Once made, this order clears the fine. Local authorities have responsibilities for supervising attendance orders. There are specialist supervised attendance officers attached to the court based social work unit. These officers monitor attendance and performance, and deal with non-compliance and breach.
