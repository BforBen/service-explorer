Service charges are payments towards the costs of providing and maintaining services for leasehold accomodation where the council is the freeholder.  As the freeholder, the council is responsible for maintaining the structure of the whole building and the communal areas such as halls and stairways.  Service charges may apply for day to day maintenance, caretaking and cleaning, repairs and improvements and a variety of other similar services.
