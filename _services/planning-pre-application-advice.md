Prior to submitting a planning application the applicant can meet with a planning officer for an informal discussion of the proposed plans.  Pre-application advice can verify the list of local requirements each planning authority can require, reduce the likelihood of submitting invalid applications and help in understanding how planning policies and other requirements affect the proposals.
