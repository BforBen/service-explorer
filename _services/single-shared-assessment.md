Single Shared Assessment (SSA) is the approach to be used by staff for all service users who need or request help from one or more professional discipline or agency. It recognises that many people have health, social care and housing needs and that agencies must work together so that assessment and subsequent care planning are person centred, needs led, co-ordinated and effective.
