Operators or carriers who handle or transport radioactive substances in excess of the threshold quantities must carry out a risk assessment (hazard identification and risk evaluation – HIRE) and send a report of the assessment to the appropriate authority.  Operators must do this 12 months before the work is to be undertaken, whilst carriers must notify 28 days before – unless agreed beforehand by the authority.
