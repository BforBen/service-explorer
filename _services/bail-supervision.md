The criminal justice social work department identify and provide services for those people on, or at risk of, a custodial remand who, if subject to supervision, could be considered for bail. This could be before trial or before sentence. As well as supervision there is also provision for services which facilitate the protection of the public by addressing the potential risk of re-offending by bailees while on bail. Bail supervision schemes identify individuals, based on assessed need, who require a level of intensive support and would suffer extreme difficulties if sent to custody. Under Bail Supervision, priority should be given to those with mental health problems, women accused, single parents and young people aged between 16 and 17.
