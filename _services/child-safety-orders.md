A CSO will be granted if there is sufficient concern about the behaviour of a child in the care of his or her family. If there is reason to suspect that the child's behaviour is a direct result of problems within the family unit, a Child Safety Order may be issued by the Family Proceedings Court in order to allow for the intervention and supervision of either local authority and/orÂ Youth Offending Teams.
