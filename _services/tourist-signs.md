Tourist signs may be placed on the highway to direct visitors to tourist attractions in the local area. The siting of such signs is the responsibility of the local highways authority. Tourist attractions and facilities (e.g. hotels) can apply for direction signs to their location. If they meet the criteria (which may vary by area) then they pay for the costs of erecting the signs.
