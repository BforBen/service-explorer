Where reservoirs exist within the local authority area the council (often jointly with theother local or national authorities) is responsible for the maintenance of the reservoir and the surrounding land and the management of reservoir use for recreation. 
In Scotland, local authorities as the Enforcement Authority have duties to maintain a register of all large raised reservoirs, to enforce the measures stipulated in relevant legislation, and to report on them to the Scottish Ministers biennially. Primary responsibility for reservoir safety, however, lies with the undertakers.
