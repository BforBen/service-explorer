Alternative provision is for pupils who canâ€™t attend mainstream school for a variety of reasons, such as school exclusion, behaviour issues, short- or long-term illness, school refusal or teenage pregnancy.  Alternative provision may be in a special school, a pupil referral unit, alternative learning unit in school or provided by the council or with independent specialist providers.
