Someone who is placed on probation will have to keep regular contact with their social worker and comply with all condition of the order. Contact will be maintained with individuals as required to ensure firm supervision of the probation conditions and may vary according to individual circumstances. During probation, social worker will visit the person's home and may involve family members to ensure the order is completed successfully. The social worker has to make sure that the conditions of the probation order are being met and also to help the probationer avoid further trouble. This involves discussing previous offences committed and looking at ways to avoid this happening again. The social worker may also direct the probationer to attend counselling or other programmes if they assess that it will help him or her avoid further trouble.
