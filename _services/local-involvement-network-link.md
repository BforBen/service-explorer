LINks are made up of individuals and community groups who work together to improve local health and care services. The job of a LINk is to find out what people like and dislike about local health and care services and work with the people who plan and run them to help make them better. This may involve talking directly to health care professionals about a service that is not being offered or suggesting ways that an existing service could be made better.
