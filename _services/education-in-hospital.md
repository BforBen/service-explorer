Teaching is provided on the Children's Wards of hospitals for those children who are well enough, but medical treatment takes precedence. When a child is discharged from hospital but is unable to return to school for some time, we can make a request for tuition at home. This is provided on medical ground and must be approved by the Local Education Authority.
