Regulation of movement of cattle between farms or to slaughter.
In the UK all movements of cattle between farms or to slaughter must be recorded on the British Cattle Movement Service's central database, the Cattle Tracing System.  In addition to the reporting of movements, a standstill period has also been introduced.  For cattle, movement of animals onto a holding will trigger a six-day standstill in which no sheep, cattle, pigs or goats can leave the farm. An exemption to this standstill can be applied for if animals have been attending a show.
