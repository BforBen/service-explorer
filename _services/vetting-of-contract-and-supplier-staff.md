Anyone who is considered for employment in a position which involves working with children or other vulnerable people needs to be vetted to ensure their suitability. 
In England and Wales the CRB has access to personal records held by the Police, the Department of Health, and the Department for Education and Skills ensuring the best possible scrutiny of applicants. 
In Scotland Disclosure Scotland provides a valuable service protecting the vulnerable people in our society by helping organisations make safer recruitment decisions when duties involve contact with children or adults at risk. Disclosure Scotland in conjunction with the Scottish Criminal Records Office (SCRO) run checks against the Scottish Criminal History System (CHS) and the UK wide Police National Computer system (PNC) in order to ensure the best possible scrutiny of applicants . Disclosure certificates contain details about an applicants' criminal convictions and Enhanced Disclosure Certificates can, in certain circumstances, contain non-conviction information.
