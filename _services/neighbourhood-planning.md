An area can be designated as a neighbourhood planning area at the request of a parish / town council, prospective neighbourhood forum or community organisation following agreement by the local planning authority and consultation with the local community (residential and business if relevant).  The relevant organisation prepares a plan or Order which is then independently assessed.  A referendum is then conducted and if the plan or order is accepted the local planning authority make the plan or Order.
