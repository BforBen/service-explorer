 A parenting contract is intended to provide parents/carers of an excluded child with the support they need and to encourage a positive joint working relationship between school and the parents/carers to address the poor behaviour in school that has led to exclusion.

The contract is a two-way, formal written agreement between a parent/carer and the governing body of a school (usually delegated to the headteacher) or the local authority.  The contract is a voluntary agreement. A parent/carer cannot be compelled to enter into a parenting contract. Equally, there is no obligation on the governing body of a school or local authority to offer a parenting contract.
