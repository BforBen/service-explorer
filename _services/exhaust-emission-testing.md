A local authority may carry out roadside vehicle emission checks in an effort to reduce pollution from road traffic.  All vehicles which are stopped will be tested to see if their vehicle is emitting pollutants above the legal standard.  Drivers of vehicles which fail the test may have to pay a fine.
