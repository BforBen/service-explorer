Local authorities must provide transport where they consider it necessary to ensure that a child goes to school. If transport is necessary, then it must be provided free of charge.  In most cases it is up to the local authority to decide what transport is necessary. Eligibility is usually determined according to age of the pupil and/or the distance which the pupil lives from school.
