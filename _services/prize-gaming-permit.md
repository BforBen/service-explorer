Prize gaming is a form of gambling in which neither the nature nor the size of the prize is determined by the number of persons playing or the amount paid for or raised by the gaming. The prize can be a cash or non-cash prize. The permit will have effect for 10 years and there is no annual fee.  The following premises are authorised by the Act to offer prize gaming, subject to certain conditions, and do not require a separate Prize Gaming Permit: Holders of Adult Gaming Centre Premises Licences / Holders of Family Entertainment Centre Premises Licences / Holders of Family Entertainment Centre Gaming Machine Permits / Travelling Fairs / Bingo Halls. Prize gaming permits do not permit the provision of gaming machines and holders of premises licences under the Act and holders of club gaming permits may not apply for prize gaming permits.
