Applications for outline planning permission seek to establish whether the scale and nature of a proposed development would be acceptable to the local planning authority, before a fully detailed proposal is put forward.  This type of planning application allows fewer details about the proposal to be submitted. Once outline permission has been granted, the applicant will need to ask for approval of the details (“reserved matters”) before work can start.
