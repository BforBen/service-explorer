Direct appointment relates to approval of a firm, public body or other organisation as an Approved Certifier of Design, or Approved Certifier of Construction.  Appointments are restricted to works where a certification scheme would not be viable, where works are of a specialised nature or where the numbers of those capable of certification is exceptionally limited.
