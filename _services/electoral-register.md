A record of everyone who lives within the boundaries of the local authority and who is eligible to vote at elections.  This is kept in two versions, full which includes all electors and edited which only includes those electors who have given permission for their details to be on the list.  The edited version must be available for viewing by the public at the council, and may be sold commercially.
