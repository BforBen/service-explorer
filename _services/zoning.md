Aiding urban regeneration by de-regulating the planning process in specific areas. In designated areas a collective scheme grants planning permission for the types of development it specifies within the zone without the need for any individual planning permission.
In the UK certain areas are designated as Simplified Planning Zones (SPZs) in which specified development is permitted.
