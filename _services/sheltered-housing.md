Sheltered housing is for retired or younger disabled people to support them to live independently in their own home and manage their own affairs, for as long as possible.  Sheltered housing typically provides a warden or other support services and access to 24 hour emergency assistance. The council carry out an assessment of applicants and maintain a waiting list until suitable properties become available.
