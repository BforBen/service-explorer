Each local authority is required to have a Children's Trust Board. The term "Children’s Trust" applies to the whole system of children’s services, covering the work of partner agencies at every level, from the development of the overall strategy to the delivery of front-line services. It is local authorities who lead Children’s Trusts working closely with the other local agencies with a legal duty to be part of the Trust: strategic health authorities, primary care trusts (PCTs), police authorities, local probation boards, youth offending teams, Connexions partnerships, the Learning and Skills Council for England and district councils.
