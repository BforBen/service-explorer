The Youth Offending Service is required to publish a plan each year which includes an Executive Summary showing how performance compares with the performance measures that are set nationally by the Youth Justice Board. Typically the plan contains a local profile of youth crime, preventive strategy, structure and budget figures for the year ahead, performance for the previous year, and lists plans and any obstacles that will be faced in achieving the targets that have been set during the forthcoming year.
