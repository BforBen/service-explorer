ATP is an agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs and on the special equipment to be used for such carriage.  For the road haulage operator only delivering foodstuffs in the UK, there is no legislative requirement for ATP.  However for operators travelling on international journeys an ATP certificate is nearly always essential.  It is illegal to transport perishable foodstuffs across an international boundary between countries that are signatories to the agreement unless the vehicle has an ATP certificate.
