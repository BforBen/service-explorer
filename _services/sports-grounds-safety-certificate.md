Designated sports grounds are required to obtain a licence in order to operate. The certificate contains such terms and conditions as the local authority considers necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety at the stadium when it is in use for the specified activity or activities. The specified activities could include non-sporting activities in addition to the sporting activities which initially attract the application.
In the UK designated grounds are those with a capacity of more than 10,000, or in the case of Premier or Football League ground more than 5,000. These figures can be amended by the Executive using powers in legislation.
