A direct payment is a cash payment allowing clients to buy their own support instead of Social Services providing it. The money can be used to employ a personal assistant or to use an agency to provide staff for you. A client can 'mix and match' and have some support provided by Social Services and take some as a direct payment. Recent 'Self-directed care' schemes have involved managing adult social care in general on the basis of the individual choosing their care package based on a fixed budget.
