A visa is a travel document that is necessary for entering a country. Whether someone needs a visa when he travels abroad depends on his nationality and the country of destination. As a resident of a country in the European Union a visa is not necessary as long as one travels within the European Union. According to whether one is going abroad as a tourist, student or to work, special requirements can be set. Visas must be applied for from the embassy or the consulate of the country in question. The citizen can find information about visas from the municipal administration.
