"Any scaffold or hoarding which encroaches or projects over the highway requires a scaffold permit. These permits are only issued to the scaffolding company. 
In Scotland if you propose to occupy or open part of a road (i.e.. carriageway, footway, footpath or cycle path etc), there is a requirement to obtain permission from the local Roads Authority. This is done by applying for the relevant permit."@en
