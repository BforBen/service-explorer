Every authority responsible for social care is required to have a Safeguarding Adults Board which helps and protects adults in their area who have care and support needs and who are experiencing, or are at risk of, abuse or neglect.  The safeguarding adults board is typically made up of representatives from the council and other organisations working in social care within the area.
