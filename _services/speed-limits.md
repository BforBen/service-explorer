The local authority (often with the local police) is responsible for setting speed limits on roads within their area.  In setting a speed limit the authority will consider the alignment of the road , the speed most motorists expect to travel along this road and the type of road and where it is located.  Applications to revise speed limits may be considered by the authority.
