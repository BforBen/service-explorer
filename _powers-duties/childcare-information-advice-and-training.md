Local authorities must secure the provision of information, advice and training to early years providers registered by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Education, Children's Services and Skills on the early years register established under the Childcare Act 2006, where an inspection report by the Chief Inspector has not yet been published for the provision, or when the most recent published report awards a grade weaker than “good” to the overall effectiveness of the early years provision, and to employees of such providers. It must also be provided to later years providers on the compulsory part of the general childcare register, where the most recent published inspection report identifies that prescribed requirements are not met and to employees of such providers.
