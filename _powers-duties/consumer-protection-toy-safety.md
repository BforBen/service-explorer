An enforcement authority may request a manufacturer or a distributor who has placed a toy on the market to cooperate with it in relation to any action taken or to be taken to eliminate any risk posed by the toy and may serve a compliance notice on an economic operator in cases of formal non-compliance and toys presenting a risk.  The LA must carry out an evaluation in relation to the toy covering all the requirements of the Regulations and may require appropriate corrective action to bring the toy into compliance or may serve a withdrawal or recall notice  If it does so it must give immediate notice to the Secretary of State
