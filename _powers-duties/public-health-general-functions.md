A local authority has the functions specified in relation to public health (including dental health) and must have regard to any document published by the Secretary of State in the exercise of prescribed functions and must make arrangements for the handling and recording of complaints.  An LA must ensure arrangements made by Local Healthwatch organisations with other persons include certain provisions about procedures, decision-making and the use of a trade mark.  An overview and scrutiny committee of a LA must acknowledge receipt of a referral of a social care matter by a Local Healthwatch organisation contractor within 20 working days
