title: "Regulatory enforcement - discretionary requirements in relation to an offence"
---

A local authority may, where deemed to be the Regulator and where authorised by an SI to do so impose discretionary requirements in relation to an offence.    Discretionary requirements may be a monetary penalty, a requirement to take such steps as a regulator may specify, within such period as it may specify, to secure that the offence does not continue or recur or a requirement to take such steps as a regulator may specify, within such period as it may specify, to secure that the position is, so far as possible, restored to what it would have been if the offence had not been committed.
