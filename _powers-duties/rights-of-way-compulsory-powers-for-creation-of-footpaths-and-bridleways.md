---

Where it appears to a local authority that there is need for a footpath bridleway or restricted byway over land in their area and they are satisfied that it is expedient that the path or way should be created, the authority may by order made by them and submitted to and confirmed by the Secretary of State, or confirmed by them as an unopposed order, create a footpath bridleway or restricted byway over the land.
