LAs/Head teachers are required to send a report to parents and adult pupils each school year on the educational achievements of pupils including levels of attainment and any other results in each attainment target.  School Leavers reports must also contain the pupil's name; school; details of any approved relevant qualification details of the pupil's progress and achievements in other subjects and in any activities forming part of the school curriculum by 30 September of the following school year.  The regulations restrict certain information and require that any document or information required must be translated into English or Welsh or another language or produced in Braille or audio tape if required.
