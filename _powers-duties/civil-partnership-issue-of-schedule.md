As soon as the waiting period in relation to each notice of proposed civil partnership has expired, the registration authority in whose area it is proposed that the registration take place is under a duty, at the request of one or both of the proposed civil partners, to issue a document to be known as a civil partnership schedule.  The authority may refuse where it has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a relevant decision was made incorrectly because of the provision of false information or evidence.
