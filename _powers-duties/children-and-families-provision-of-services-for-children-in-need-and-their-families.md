Every local authority shall, in making any arrangements for the provision of day care within their area; or designed to encourage persons to act as local authority foster parents, have regard to the different racial groups to which children within their area who are in need belong.    Every local authority shall facilitate the provision by others (including in particular voluntary organisations) of services which it is a function of the authority to provide
