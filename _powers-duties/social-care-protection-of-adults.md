A local authority must only authorise a person who has relevant experience, has completed appropriate training and is an officer of that local authority to apply for an adult protection and support order under section 127 of the Social Services and Well Being (Wales) Act 2014.  Where that is not practicable, a LA may authorise a person with relevant experience, who has completed appropriate training and who is an officer of a LA within a certain safeguarding board area, or failing that, of a LA in Wales.  Where that is not practical, an officer of that LA who has relevant experience.
