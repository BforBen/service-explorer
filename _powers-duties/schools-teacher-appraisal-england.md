Local authorities/governing bodies must have a written document setting out the appraisal process for teachers; set objectives for teachers and inform each teacher of the standards against which performances are to be assessed. Such standards must be as prescribed.  A governing body must consult the external adviser in setting objectives for a head teacher.
