Local authorities (food authorities) must enforce these regulations in their areas (implementing Council Directive 2001/114/EC relating to certain partly or wholly dehydrated preserved milk products intended for human consumption and Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers).  The regulations define condensed milk and dried milk products and the reserved descriptions that apply to them; prohibit labelling with reserved descriptions of food other than the designated condensed and dried milk products to which they relate, enabling improvement notices to be served to require compliance with regulations, 3, 4 and 5 and make failure to comply an offence.
