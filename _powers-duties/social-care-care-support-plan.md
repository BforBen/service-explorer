Where a local authority is required to meet needs under sections or 20(1) or decides to do so under sections 19(1) and (2) or 20(6), it must—
(a) prepare a care and support plan or a support plan for the adult concerned (in accordance with sections 25 and 26 in so far as in force),
(b) tell the adult which (if any) of the needs that it is going to meet may be met by direct payments, and
(c) help the adult with deciding how to have the needs met.

Where a local authority has carried out a needs or carer's assessment but is not required to meet needs and does not decide to do so it must give the adult concerned—
(a) its written reasons for not meeting the needs, and
(b) (unless it has already done so) advice and information about—
(i) what can be done to meet or reduce the needs;
(ii) what can be done to prevent or delay the development by the adult concerned of needs for care and support or of needs for support in the future.
