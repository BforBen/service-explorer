A authority may give a warning notice to the governing body of a maintained school where the authority are satisfied that the standards of performance of pupils at the school are unacceptably low, and are likely to remain so unless the authority exercise their powers under this Part, or that there has been a serious breakdown in the way the school is managed or governed which is prejudicing, or likely to prejudice, such standards of performance, or that the safety of pupils or staff of the school is threatened (whether by a breakdown of discipline or otherwise).
