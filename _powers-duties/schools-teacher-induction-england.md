title: "Schools - teacher induction (England)"
---

The head teacher of an institution in which a person is serving an induction period and the local authority (as the “appropriate body”) are responsible for that person's supervision and training during that induction period.  Where a person serving an induction period is employed in two or more institutions simultaneously, the head teachers of those institutions must agree which of them, and which appropriate body, is to be responsible for that person's supervision and training.  On completion of an induction, the head teacher or principal of the institution where induction is completed must make a recommendation to the appropriate body as to whether standards have been met.
