An inspector may, at all reasonable times, inspect and test any weighing or measuring equipment which is, or which he has reasonable cause to believe to be, used for trade or in the possession of any person or upon any premises for such use, inspect any goods regarding which a representation has been made as to the quantity of any goods offered or exposed for sale or sold, and enter any premises at which he has reasonable cause to believe there to be any such equipment or goods, not being premises used only as a private dwelling-house.
