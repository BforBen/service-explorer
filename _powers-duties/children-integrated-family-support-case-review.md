Except for a looked after child whose case is already subject to review under the Review of Children's Cases (Wales) Regulations 2007, where integrated family support (IFS) teams are set up, a local authority must review the cases of families whose cases are supported by an IFS team in the prescribed manner and at the prescribed times and intervals and set out in writing its arrangements for reviewing cases.
