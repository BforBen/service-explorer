Local authorities must carry out the assessment of a young carerâ€™s needs appropriately and proportionately and must provide information about the manner and form of the assessment so far as reasonably practicable before it takes place.  
LAs must ensure that a person carrying out the assessment on their behalf is appropriately trained and has sufficient knowledge and skill to carry out that assessment; consult others with expertise and knowledge in relation to the young carer and must have regard to any other assessment which may have been carried out.  LAs must consider the prescribed matters when carrying out the assessment.
