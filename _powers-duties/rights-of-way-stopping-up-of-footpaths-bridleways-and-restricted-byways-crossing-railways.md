title: "Rights of way - stopping up of footpaths, bridleways and restricted byways crossing railways"
---

Where it appears to a council expedient in the interests of the safety of members of the public using it or likely to use it that a footpath, bridleway or restricted byway in their area which crosses a railway, otherwise than by tunnel or bridge, should be stopped up, the council may by order made by them and submitted to and confirmed by the Secretary of State, or confirmed as an unopposed order, extinguish the public right of way
