---

Local authorities must designate a senior officer to be responsible for ensuring compliance with arrangements made by the authority; appoint a complaints officer to manage the procedure for handling and consideration of representations made to them about the discharge of specific functions under the Children Act 1989 and under the Adoption and Children Act 2002.

An LA must ensure that its staff are appropriately trained and follow the prescribed procedure for the handling and investigation of representations, monitor their own arrangements and produce an annual report.
