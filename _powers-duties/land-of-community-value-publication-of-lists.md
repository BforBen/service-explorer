The local authority must maintain a list of land which is considered an asset of community value and a list of land in its area that has been nominated by an unsuccessful community nomination (as a community asset).      Both lists must be published and made available for free inspection by any person.  A free copy of either list must be provided to any person who asks for a copy.
