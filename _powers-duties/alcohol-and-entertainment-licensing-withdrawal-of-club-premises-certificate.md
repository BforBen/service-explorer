title: "Alcohol and entertainment licensing -  withdrawal of club premises certificate"
---

Where a club holds a club premises certificate, and it appears to the relevant licensing authority that the club does not satisfy the conditions for being a qualifying club in relation to a qualifying club activity to which the certificate relates, the authority must give a notice to the club withdrawing the certificate, so far as relating to that activity.
