Where a fire and rescue authority is satisfied in respect of any particular station premises that compliance with a requirement of any of the provisions of regulations 5(2), 6(2), 9(8) and 10(2) is inappropriate, unnecessary or not reasonably practicable, the fire and rescue authority may by notice in writing to the occupier of the premises grant exemption from compliance with the requirement to such extent as is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case and in particular to the risk in case of fire to persons in the premises.
