LAs in Wales have discretionary powers to prevent, protect against, control or provide a public health response to the incidence or spread of infection or contamination which presents or could present significant harm to human health. LAs can require that a child is kept away from school; a head teacher provide it with the names and contact details of the pupils at the school; disinfect or decontaminate things or premises on request from the owner or tenant; request specified things for health protection purposes and offer compensation or expenses in relation to a request; restrict contact with, and access to, a dead body and take action to relocate a dead body.
