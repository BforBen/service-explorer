It shall be the duty of a local authority to secure that, so far as practicable, the interests of that authority in any negotiations with respect to the terms and conditions on which persons in local authority employment hold office or are employed are never represented, whether directly or indirectly by, or by persons who include a person who is both a member of the authority and in such employment; or a person who is both a member of the authority and an official or employee of a trade union whose members include persons in local authority employment.
