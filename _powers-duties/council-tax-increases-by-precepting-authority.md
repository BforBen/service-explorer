title: "Council tax - increases by precepting authority"
---

An authority which is a major or local precepting authority must notify its billing authorities if it has set an excessive relevant basic amount of council tax for a financial year by a specified date.

Where a billing authority holds a referendum on behalf of a major or local precepting authority it can recover its costs from the precepting authority unless it has failed to do so or is in default.
