Local authorities and Local Health Boards (referred to in the Regulations as “responsible bodies”) must jointly assess the matters specified in section 14(1)(a) to (f) of the Social Services and Well Being (Wales) Act. These matters include the extent to which there are people in the LA's area who need care and support and the extent to which there are carers in the area who need support. They must have regard to the statement of well-being outcomes when carrying out population assessments; engage with prescribed persons and bodies; jointly produce a report of the outcome of an assessment; publicise and submit to the Welsh ministers and review as prescribed.
