A local authority which is an “Approved Authority” may deduct from charges received from undertakers pursuant to the Regulations, its reasonable costs of operating and evaluating the effectiveness of the scheme under which they are paid.  It must apply the net proceeds for purposes intended to reduce the disruption and other adverse effects caused by street works and must keep and publish yearly accounts of sums received by way of charges.
