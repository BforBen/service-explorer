title: "Education -  provision and funding of higher education in maintained schools"
---

A governing body of a school maintained by a local authority may arrange the provision to pupils at the school courses in preparation for professional examinations at a higher level or providing education at a higher level.      A governing body may exercise the power in relation to a particular pupil only if they are satisfied that the provision to that pupil of the course in question will not to any significant extent interfere with the other education with which he is being provided at the school.
