(b) the authority is satisfied that it is not required to meet the adult's needs under section18.
A local authority, having made a determination under section 13(1), may meet an adult's needs for care and support which meet the eligibility criteria if—
(a) the adult is ordinarily resident in the area of another local authority,
(b) there is no charge under section for meeting the needs or, in so far as there is such a charge, condition 1, 2 or 3 in section is met, and
(c) the authority has notified the other local authority of its intention to meet the needs.
(3) A local authority may meet an adult's needs for care and support which appear to it to be urgent (regardless of whether the adult is ordinarily resident in its area) without having yet—
(a) carried out a needs assessment or a financial assessment, or
(b) made a determination under section 13(1).
(4) A local authority may meet an adult's needs under (3) where, for example, the adult is terminally ill.
