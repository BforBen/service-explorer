Where it appears to a local authority that a child is likely to have needs for care and support after becoming 18, the authority must, if it is satisfied that it would be of significant benefit to the child to do so and if the consent condition is met, assessâ€”
(a) whether the child has needs for care and support and, if so, what those needs are, and
(b) whether the child is likely to have needs for care and support after becoming 18 and, if so, what those needs are likely to be.
This assessment is referred to as a child's needs assessment
