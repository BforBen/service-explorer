title: "Registration - marriage/civil partnership gender recognition register"
---

Local authorities (the Registrar General) must maintain a Gender Recognition Marriage Register, and a Gender Recognition Civil Partnership Register, which must not be open for public inspection or search.  The Registrar General must register the marriage and create a link (which is not to be open to public inspection) between the original marriage register entry and the new entry in the Gender Recognition Marriage Register and maintain the details in the registers as prescribed.
