A non-metropolitan district council that was formerly subject to a scheme for elections by halves, but is for the time being subject to a scheme for whole-council elections, may resolve that it is to revert to being subject to a scheme for elections by halves.    The council must comply with requirements when passing a resolution for elections by halves.
