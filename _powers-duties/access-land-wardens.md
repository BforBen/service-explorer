An access authority or a district council may appoint such number of persons as may appear to the authority making the appointment to be necessary or expedient, to act as wardens as respects access land in their area.    As respects access land in an area for which there is a local access forum, an access authority shall, before they appoint wardens and thereafter from time to time, consult the local access forum about the exercise of that power.
