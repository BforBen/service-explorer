title: "Consumer rights - complaints regarding unfair contract terms and notices"
---

A local authority may consider a complaint about a term or notice to which the Schedule applies (a “relevant complaint”).
If a regulator other than the Competition and Markets Authority intends to consider a relevant complaint, it must notify the CMA that it intends to do so, and must then consider the complaint.
If a regulator considers a relevant complaint, but decides not to make an application relation to the complaint, it must give reasons for its decision to the person who made the complaint.
