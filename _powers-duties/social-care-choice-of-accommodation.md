title: "Social care - choice of accommodation"
---

These regulations are made under section 30 of the Care Act and require local authorities to meet an adultâ€™s preference for a particular accommodation type, provided that specified conditions are met.  Where the cost of an adult's preferred accommodation is more than the amount specified for the accommodation in the adult's personal budget (under section 26 of the Act), the local authority is not required to provide that accommodation unless the additional cost condition is met.  A local authority must give written reasons for a refusal to provide preferred accommodation.
