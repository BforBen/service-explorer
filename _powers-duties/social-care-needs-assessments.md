title: "Social care - needs assessments"
---

Local authorities must carry out assessments under Sections 9 and 10 of the Care Act in the manner prescribed in relation to the likely care and support needs of a child or young carer on becoming an adult and the support needs of an adult carer of a child.  Local authorities must ensure persons carrying out assessments have the appropriate training and expertise and consult with experts as prescribed and specifically for individuals who are deafblind.  Local authorities must make a referral to the health service where it appears that the individual whose needs are being assessed may have a need for NHS Continuing Healthcare.
