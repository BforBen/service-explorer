title: "Marine Conservation Zones - furthering conservation objectives"
---

A local authority must exercise its functions in a way which the authority considers best furthers the conservation objectives stated for the Marine Conservation Zone or where it is not possible to exercise its functions in a manner which furthers those objectives, exercise them in the manner which the authority considers least hinders the achievement of those objectives.      If an authority considers that any of its functions is such that the exercise of the function would or might significantly hinder the achievement of the conservation objectives for an MCZ, it must inform the appropriate statutory conservation body of that fact.
