A local housing authority may give assistance by way of grant or loan to voluntary organisations concerned with homelessness or matters relating to homelessness.    A local housing authority may also assist any such organisation by permitting them to use premises belonging to the authority, by making available furniture or other goods, whether by way of gift, loan or otherwise, and by making available the services of staff employed by the authority.
