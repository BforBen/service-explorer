title: "Premises closure notice - issue and duration"
---

A local authority may issue a closure notice if satisfied on reasonable groundsâ€”
that the use of particular premises has resulted, or (if the notice is not issued) is likely soon to result, in nuisance to members of the public, or
that there has been, or (if the notice is not issued) is likely soon to be, disorder near those premises associated with the use of those premises,
and that the notice is necessary to prevent the nuisance or disorder from continuing, recurring or occurring.
