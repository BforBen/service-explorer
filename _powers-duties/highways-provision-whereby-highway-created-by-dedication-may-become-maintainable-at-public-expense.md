Where it is proposed to dedicate a way as a highway, if the council consider that the proposed highway will not be of sufficient utility to the public to justify its being maintained at the public expense, they may make a complaint to a magistrates' court for an order to that effect.  If the council certify that the way has been dedicated in accordance with the terms of the notice and has been made up in a satisfactory manner, the highway shall become for the purposes of this Act a highway maintainable at the public expense.
