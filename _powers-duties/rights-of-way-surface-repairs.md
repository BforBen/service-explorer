Where the surface of a footpath, a bridleway, or any other highway which consists of or comprises a carriageway other than a made-up carriageway, has been so disturbed as to render it inconvenient for the exercise of the public right of way, a competent authority may make good the surface to an extent not less than the minimum width nor greater than the maximum width.
