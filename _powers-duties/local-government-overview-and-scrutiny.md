title: "Local Government - overview and scrutiny"
---

A local authority cannot refer to an overview and scrutiny committee the excluded matters specified in article 3, but can refer a matter which consists of an allegation of systemic failure of a LA to discharge a function for which the LA is responsible, notwithstanding the fact that the allegation specifies matters which would otherwise be excluded by virtue of article 3.
