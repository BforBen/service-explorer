title: "Schools - prohibited items"
---

School staff can search pupils for prohibited items: tobacco and cigarette papers and other tobacco based products, fireworks, and pornography.  Tobacco and fireworks may be kept or disposed of.  Any pornography may be disposed of unless possession constitutes a specified offence. Where this is the case, it must be taken to the police as soon as possible.
