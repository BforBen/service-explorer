LAs must determine the size of a shadow governing body which may be appointed from various categories and may remove a shadow governor at any time for incapacity or misbehaviour.  It may be established at least six months before the interim executive board is to become a normally constituted governing body. 

The Regulations prescribe the conduct of the governing body
and procedure for the transition from an interim executive board to a normally constituted governing body.
