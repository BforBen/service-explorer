A Welsh local authority must secure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the provision of childcare (whether or not by them) is sufficient to meet the requirements of parents in their area who require childcare in order to enable them to take up, or remain in, work, or to undertake education or training which could reasonably be expected to assist them to obtain work.    In discharging their duty a local authority must have regard to any guidance given from time to time by the Assembly.
