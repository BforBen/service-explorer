title: "Special educational needs or disability - provision at other institution"
---

A local authority may arrange for any special educational provision that it has decided is necessary for a child or young person for whom it is responsible to be made otherwise than in a school or post-16 institution or a place at which relevant early years education is provided.
An authority may do so only if satisfied that it would be inappropriate for the provision to be made in a school or post-16 institution or at such a place.

Before doing so, the authority must consult the child's parent or the young person.
