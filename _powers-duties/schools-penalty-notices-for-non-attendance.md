title: "Schools - penalty notices for non-attendance"
---

A school must include prescribed information in a penalty notice (operated under section 444A of the Education Act 1996) and provide a copy to the local authority.  A local authority may issue a notice in prescribed circumstances and may withdraw a penalty notice where it determines that it ought not to have been issued or contains material errors. It must draw up and consult on a code of conduct for the issuing of penalty notices and keep records as detailed. It must provide information to the Welsh Ministers if required and spend sums received as prescribed.
