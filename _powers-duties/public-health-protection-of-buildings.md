title: "Public health - protection of buildings"
---

Where it appears to a local authority that any building in their area is unoccupied; or that the occupier of a building in their area is temporarily absent from it and it is not effectively secured against unauthorised entry; or is likely to become a danger to public health, the local authority may undertake works in connection with the building for the purpose of preventing unauthorised entry to it, or, as the case may be, for the purpose of preventing it becoming a danger to public health.
