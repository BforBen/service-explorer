title: "Social care - protection of property"
---

Where an adult is having needs for care and support met under sections 18 or 19 in a way that involves the provision of accommodation, or is admitted to hospital (or both), and
(b) it appears to a local authority that there is a danger of loss or damage to movable property of the adult's in the authority's area because—
(i) the adult is unable (whether permanently or temporarily) to protect or deal with the property, and
(ii) no suitable arrangements have been or are being made.
The local authority must take reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate the loss or damage.
For the purpose of performing that duty, the local authority—
(a) may at all reasonable times and on reasonable notice enter any premises which the adult was living in immediately before being provided with accommodation or admitted to hospital, and
(b) may deal with any of the adult's movable property in any way which is reasonably necessary for preventing or mitigating loss or damage
