title: "Social care - required carer support"
---

Subject to the exception contained in sections 21 to 23, a local authority having made a determination under section 13(1) must meet a carer's needs for support which meet the eligibility criteria if—
(a) the adult needing care is ordinarily resident in the local authority's area or is present in its area but of no settled residence,
(b) in so far as meeting the carer's needs involves the provision of support to the carer, there is no charge under section 14 for meeting the needs or, in so far as there is, condition 1 or 2 (of section 20) is met, and
(c) in so far as meeting the carer's needs involves the provision of care and support to the adult needing care—
(i) there is no charge under  section 14 for meeting the needs and the adult needing care agrees to the needs being met in that way, or
(ii) in so far as there is such a charge, condition 3 or 4 (of section 20) is met.

Where a local authority is required by this section to meet some or all of a carer's needs for support but it does not prove feasible for it to do so by providing care and support to the adult needing care, it must, so far as it is feasible to do so, identify some other way in which to do so.
