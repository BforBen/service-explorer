An LA must make an application to the High Court to request a competent authority of the Contracting State of the habitual residence of a child for authorisation to exercise jurisdiction if an application in respect of a child under section 31 of the Children Act 1989 (care and supervision orders) is to be made and it must provide a report to the competent authority of the other Contracting State in accordance with Article 33(1) of the Convention if it is exercising jurisdiction under the Convention.
