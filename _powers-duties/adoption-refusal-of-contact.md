A local authority may refuse to allow the contact that would otherwise be required by virtue of an order if it is satisfied that it is necessary to do so in order to safeguard or promote the child's welfare, and  the refusal is decided upon as a matter of urgency and does not last for more than seven days.  The authority must comply with regulations when refusing contact.
