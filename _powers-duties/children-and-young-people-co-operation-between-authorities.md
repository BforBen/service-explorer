Where it appears to a local authority that any authority (local authority, local housing authority, health board etc) could, by taking any specified action, help in the exercise of any of their functions, they may request the help of that other authority.  An authority whose help is so requested shall comply with the request if it is compatible with their own statutory or other duties and obligations and does not unduly prejudice the discharge of any of their functions.
