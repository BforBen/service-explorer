Where a local housing authority are satisfied that the living conditions in an area within their district consisting primarily of housing accommodation are unsatisfactory, and that those conditions can most effectively be dealt with by declaring the area to be a renewal area, then, subject to provisions, they may cause the area to be defined on a map and by resolution declare it to be a renewal area
