Where a local authority, having carried out a child's carer's assessment, is satisfied that the carer has needs for support, it may meet such of those needs as it considers appropriate.

In deciding whether or how to exercise this power, a local authority must have regard to Regulations and any services being provided to the carer under section 17 of the Children Act 1989.
