Each local authority (“food authority”) must enforce the European poultry meat provisions in its area (other than at slaughterhouses and cutting plants); at retail shop and premises adjacent to sales points where cutting and handling are performed solely for the purpose of supplying the consumer directly on the spot with fresh poultrymeat (which must be kept at a temperature not below – 2ºC and not higher than 8ºC).
