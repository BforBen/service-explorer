Where a local authority maintains an EHC plan for a child or young person, a person authorised by the authority is entitled to have access at any reasonable time to the premises of a school, post-16 institution or other institution at which education or training is provided in pursuance of the plan, for the purpose of monitoring the education or training.
This power does not apply to the premises of a mainstream post-16 institution in Wales.
