A fire and rescue authority must take all reasonable measures for securing that an adequate supply of water will be available for the authority's use in the event of fire.  An authority may use any suitable supply of water for the purposes of extinguishing a fire or protecting life or property in the event of a fire (but must pay reasonable compensation for the water).
