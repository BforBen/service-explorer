Each billing authority shall compile and maintain, a list (to be called its rural settlement list).  It shall identify for each such year any settlements which are wholly or partly within the authority's area, appear to the authority to have had a population of not more than 3,000 on the last 31st December before the beginning of the chargeable financial year in question, and in that financial year are wholly or partly within an area designated by the Secretary of State by order as a rural area for the purposes of this section.
