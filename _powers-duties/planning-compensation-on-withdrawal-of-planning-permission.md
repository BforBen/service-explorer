When local authorities withdraw the development rights prescribed, compensation is only payable in respect of planning applications made within 12 months beginning on the date the directions took effect. They may use the mechanism prescribed for the permitted development rights to be withdrawn without compensation being payable, provided the prescribed procedures are followed as to the manner of withdrawal, the manner of publishing the withdrawal and the maximum period of notice that may be given in respect of withdrawal. Likewise regarding permitted development rights granted by a local development order, and in respect of neighbourhood development orders
