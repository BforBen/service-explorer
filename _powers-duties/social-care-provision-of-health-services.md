---

Local authorities must obtain consent under 22 (4) of the Care Act 2014 from the CCG which has the responsibility for arranging for the provision of nursing care by a registered nurse in respect of the person concerned.  Local authorities must work with NHS bodies in the processes for assessing a person's needs for health care and for deciding how those needs must be met including requirements regarding participation in review panels.  LAs must make arrangements for determining any disputes between themselves and NHS bodies about whether or not something should be provided by the NHS as part of the health service.
