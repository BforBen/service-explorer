A billing authority may reduce any amount a person is liable to pay for hereditaments or remit payment of the whole of any amount a person would otherwise be liable to pay if the ratepayer would sustain and it is reasonable for the authority to do so, having regard to the interests of persons liable to pay council tax set by it.
