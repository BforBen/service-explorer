A local authority must comply with the regulations, made under section 34A of the Housing Act 1985, which set out the procedure to be followed where a tenant group wishes to serve a notice on an authority proposing that the authority should dispose of particular land used for housing purposes under Part 2 of the Housing Act 1985 to a private registered provider of social housing. A local authority must co-operate where a notice is served pursuant to these Regulations.
