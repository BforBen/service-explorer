---

A local authority or an authorised officer may 

make a purchase of a product, or
 enter into an agreement to secure the provision of a product.

And for these purposes an officer may â€”

at any reasonable time, enter premises to which the public has access (whether or not the public has access at that time), and
 inspect any product on the premises which the public may inspect.
The power of entry may be exercised without first giving notice or obtaining a warrant.
