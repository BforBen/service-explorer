Where a member of a local authority discharges any function of the authority by virtue of arrangements made under section 236 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 (exercise of functions by local councillors in England), that member mustâ€”
(a) ensure that a record is made in writing of any decision made or action taken in connection with the discharge of that function; and
(b) within one month of the date on which the decision is made, or action taken, provide the record to the authority.
The authority may also withdraw that exemption by notice.
