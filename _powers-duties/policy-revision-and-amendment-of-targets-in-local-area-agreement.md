Any local improvement target other than a designated target for the time being specified in a local area agreement may be amended, or  removed from the local area agreement,by the responsible local authority with the agreement of any partner authority to which the target relates and after consulting each other person to whom it relates.    The responsible local authority may, with the consent of each person to whom the target in question is to relate, specify a new local improvement target in a local area agreement.  Designated targets may only be amended following consultation with the Secretary of State.
