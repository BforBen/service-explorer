A local authority who are for the time being, or have at any time been, a local weights and measures authority under this Act or the Weights and Measures Act 1963 may provide and maintain within their area for use by the public such weighing or measuring equipment as may appear to the authority to be expedient.

Without prejudice to the provisions of any other Act, and subject to section 18 above, a local authority may employ persons to attend to any weighing or measuring by means of equipment provided by that authority for use by the public.

Except in the case of a weighing or measuring for which, under any other Act, the charge falls to be regulated from time to time by some other person, a local authority by whom any weighing or measuring equipment is provided for use by the public may make such charges for any weighing or measuring by means of that equipment as they may from time to time think fit.
