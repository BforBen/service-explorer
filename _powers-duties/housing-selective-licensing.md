title: "Housing - selective licensing"
---

A local housing authority may make a selective licensing designation in relation to an area if a set of conditions (in addition to those set out in section 80 of the Housing Act 2004) is satisfied in relation to an area.  It must contain a high proportion of properties in the private rented sector, in relation to the total housing accommodation in that area. These privately rented properties must be occupied under assured tenancies or licenses to occupy.
