Local authorities must appoint a person, who is a member of staff, to deal with a review request under section 73 of the Social Services and Well Being (Wales) Act 2014; must accept or reject the request and follow the procedure prescribed.  LAs may recover any accrued amounts after the review period.  If the requester notifies the LA that they will not pay the contribution during the review period, the LA must make gross payments during the review period and return any over payment to the requester or recover any underpayment as prescribed.
