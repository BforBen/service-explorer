Where for the purpose of relieving or preventing congestion of traffic it appears to a local authority to be necessary to provide within their area suitable parking places for vehicles, the local authority may provide off-street parking places or may by order authorise the use as a parking place of any part of a road within their area, not being a road the whole or part of the width of which is within Greater London.
