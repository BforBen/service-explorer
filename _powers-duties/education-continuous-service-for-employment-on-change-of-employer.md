There is a duty to recognise continuity of service for employment purposes as follows. If an employee of the governing body of a school maintained by a local authority is taken into the employment of the authority or an employee of a local authority is taken into the employment of the governing body of a school maintained by the authority his period of employment at the time of the change of employer counts as a period of employment with the second employer, and the change does not break the continuity of the period of employment.
