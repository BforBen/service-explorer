title: "Social care - carer support assessment when child becomes 18"
---

Where it appears to a local authority that a carer of a child is likely to have needs for support after the child becomes 18, the authority must, if it is satisfied that it would be of significant benefit to the carer to do so, assessâ€”
(a) whether the carer has needs for support and, if so, what those needs are, and
(b) whether the carer is likely to have needs for support after the child becomes 18 and, if so, what those needs are likely to be.
An assessment is referred to in this Part as a child's carer's assessment
