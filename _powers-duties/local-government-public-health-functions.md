Local authorities must exercise prescribed public health functions in their area including arranging the weighing and measuring of certain children, health checks for eligible persons, access to sexual health services, a public health advice service to any clinical commissioning groups in their area, health protection arrangements against any threat to the health of the local population, including infectious disease, environmental hazards and extreme weather events.  A local authority may make and recover charges in respect of certain steps taken in the exercise of its duty as to health improvement, but not in respect of anything which the local authority is required to do in exercise of its prescribed public health functions.
