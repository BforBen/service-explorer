Local authorities must follow the prescribed procedures where there is a dispute between local authorities regarding a person's ordinary residence under Part 1 of the Care Act 2014, or about the application of sections 37 (continuity of care and support – notification and assessment) or 48 (provider failure – temporary duty on local authority) of that Act or disputes under section 117 of the Mental Health Act.   A local authority has the duty of meeting an individual's needs until the dispute is resolved as prescribed.
