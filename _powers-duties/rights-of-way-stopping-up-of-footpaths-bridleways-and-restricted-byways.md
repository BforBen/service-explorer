title: "Rights of way - stopping up of footpaths, bridleways and restricted byways"
---

Where it appears to a council as respects a footpath, bridleway or restricted byway in their area that it is expedient that the path or way should be stopped up on the ground that it is not needed for public use, the council may by order made by them and submitted to and confirmed by the Secretary of State, or confirmed as an unopposed order, extinguish the public right of way over the path or way.
