Local authorities (housing authorities) must serve a remedial notice where  there are reasonable grounds to believe a landlord is in breach of a duty under the regulations and, if no action is taken, arrange for remedial action to be taken and impose a penalty notice following the prescribed procedure.  LAs must also publish a statement of principles regarding penalty notices.
