A competent authority may, by notice to the occupier of premises adjoining a highway, require him within 28 days from the date of service of the notice to construct or erect and thereafter to maintain such channels, gutters or downpipes as may be necessary to prevent water from the roof or any other part of the premises falling upon persons using the highway, or so far as is reasonably practicable, surface water from the premises flowing on to, or over, the footway of the highway.
