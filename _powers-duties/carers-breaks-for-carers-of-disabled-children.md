title: "Carers - breaks for carers of disabled children"
---

The LA must provide a range of short breaks services to assist parents and others who provide care for disabled children; have regard to the needs of those carers who would be able to provide care more effectively if they had breaks from caring, and the needs of those carers who would be unable to continue to provide care unless a break were offered to them.   LAs in consultation with carers in their area, must prepare, publish, and keep under review, a “short breaks services statement” setting out what services are available, the categories of carer who may be eligible to gain access to them, and how they are designed to meet the needs of carers in the area.
