A person authorised by a local authority may, where a person is or has been consuming alcohol in breach of a prohibition in a public spaces protection order, or intends to consume alcohol in circumstances in which doing so would be a breach of such a prohibition, (upon showing his identity) require that person not to consume, in breach of the order, alcohol or anything which the authorised person reasonably believes to be alcohol; or to surrender anything in that personâ€™s possession which is, or which the authorised person reasonably believes to be, alcohol or a container for alcohol (and dispose of the same).  If the person fails to co-operate he commits a criminal offence.
