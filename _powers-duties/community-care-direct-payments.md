A local authority must, in prescribed circumstances, or may, make direct payments to persons who have, or lack, the capacity to consent to the making of a direct payment where their needs are met by such a payment and what amount (if any) it is reasonably practicable to pay towards securing the provision of the relevant service (either reimbursement or by contribution).  A local authority must or may impose conditions in respect of direct payments to persons with the capacity to consent and to persons lacking capacity respectively.  An authority may require a direct payment to be repaid if it has not been used to secure the provision of service to which it relates.  A local authority must review and must or may stop the making of direct payments in certain prescribed circumstances.
