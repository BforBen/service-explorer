Regulations making provision about information in council tax demand notices including the dwelling to which the notice relates, the valuation band applicable to the dwelling, the amount of council tax payable in respect of the dwelling and comparisons with the preceding year and whether an authority's relevant basic amount of council tax for a year is excessive.  Precepting authorities and levying bodies must also supply information to billing authorities.
