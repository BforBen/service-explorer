A local authority must conduct a survey after each ordinary election to the council of the county or county borough and to each community in the local authority's area by asking prescribed questions of councillors and unsuccessful candidates who have stood for election as councillors in the local authority's area. The questions relate to gender, sexual orientation, language, race, age, disability, religion or belief, health, education and qualifications, employment, work as a councillor, party affiliation, involvement with the third sector and length of political activity.  Survey information must be collated in an electronic spreadsheet. Details relating to the spreadsheet will be included in guidance.
