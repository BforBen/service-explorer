title: "Children and families - provision of accommodation for children"
---

Every local authority shall provide accommodation for any child in need within their area.  Where a local authority provide accommodation for a child who is ordinarily resident in the area of another local authority, that other local authority may take over the provision of accommodation for the child within three months of being notified in writing.    A local authority may provide accommodation for any person who has reached the age of sixteen but is under twenty-one in any community home which takes children who have reached the age of sixteen if they consider that to do so would safeguard or promote his welfare.
