---

Local authorities as prescribed must arrange for a representative to visit a child within 10 working days of the child first being detained or required to reside in approve premises and thereafter whenever reasonably requested to do so by specified persons, for example, the child, the child's parents, or in line with the recommendations made by the representative. During each visit, the representative must speak to the child in private unless it is not appropriate to do so or the child refuses and provide a report of each visit providing content and copies as prescribed.  LAs must also have regard to the further provision in relation to the duty under section 97(3)(b) of the Social Services and Well Being (Wales) Act 2014 to arrange for advice and support to be available to the child.
