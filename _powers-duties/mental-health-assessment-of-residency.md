A LA is responsible for determining within which local area an adult (who is a former user of secondary mental health services) resides, where there is a question about whether an adult's usual or most residence is situated within a particular LA area.

However, where the local mental health partners for another LA area agree to act as the local mental health partners for an adult, then that adult is deemed to be usually resident within that other LA area
