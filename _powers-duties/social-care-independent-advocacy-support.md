When making arrangements for a person to be an independent advocate under Section 67 of the Care Act 2014 local authorities must be satisfied that a person meets the prescribed requirements.  Local authorities must have regard to the prescribed matters when deciding whether a person would experience substantial difficulty, whether there are prescribed circumstances which would disapply the duty and the provisions on working with an independent advocate.
