LAs must exercise their nature conservation functions so as to comply with the Habitats Directive and consider the effect on a European site before the granting consents or authorisations including the grant of planning permission and subject to specified exceptions (considerations of overriding public interest), may not authorise a plan or project that may adversely affect the integrity of a European site.
