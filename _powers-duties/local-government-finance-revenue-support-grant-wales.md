The Welsh Ministers shall calculate what sum, if any, falls to be paid to each receiving authority by way of revenue support grant for the year in accordance with the basis of distribution agreed.  Where the Welsh Ministers make a calculation that shows a decrease in the sum that falls to be paid to a receiving authority, the authority shall pay to the Welsh Ministers a sum equal to the difference.
