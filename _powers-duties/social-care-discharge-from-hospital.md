A local authority to which an assessment notice (under Section 79/Schedule 3 of the Care Act) is given must accept that notice and undertake the duties in relation to the patient notwithstanding that it may dispute that patient's ordinary residence. A local authority which has wrongly been given an assessment notice may claim reimbursement for any delayed discharge payment it has paid in that case from the local authority in whose area the patient is later agreed or determined to be ordinarily resident.
